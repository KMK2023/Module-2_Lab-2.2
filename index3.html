  <h2>V. Styling links </h2>

  <p>In this section we will be styling links in different states:
    • a, a:link - link in its untouched form
    • a:visited - link that has been visited
    • a:hover - link that is hovered with a cursor
    • a:active - link that has been “hovered” using keyboard
    • a:focus - link that has been clicked but the cursor is still not released or the browser is navigating to another
    webpage
    Note that links come with a lot of styling from the browser. It is common to reset all those styles before
    developing
    CSS to simplify the styling process.
    1. a, a:link, a:visited
    1.1 Style link in its basic form, set font color (using `color` CSS property)
    1.2 Consider using color, font-size, font-weight, font-decoration and border for your styles and feel free to use
    any
    other styles.
    2. a:hover, :active, a:focus
    3. Many websites do not apply special styling to a:visited links. Extract a:visited link and apply a style using CSS
    for it.
    2.1. If you do not create style for a:visited the styles will leak from `a` and `a:link` CSS rules</p>

  <h2>VI. calc() </h2>
  <p>In this section we will perform simple calculations using calc.
    1. Try setting `width: 100vw;` on .calc-style class. The element should overflow outside of the screen.
    1.1 Set `width: calc(100vw - 100px);` on .calc-style class. Now the element occupies 100px less than the entire
    width
    of the screen.
    1.3 While in this example we could just use `width: 100%`, Sometimes you will stumble upon scenarios where the
    `width:
    100%` solution does not work due to other CSS properties. calc() is not commonly used and should be avoided. At the
    same time a lot of CSS frameworks use calc() internally so when we are using CSS frameworks we usually do not need
    to
    use calc().</p>

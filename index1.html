  <h2>III. Positioning</h2>
  In this classes you will be editing
  1. Absolute
  1.1 Set absolute position on .position-absolute class
  2. relative and absolute
  2.1 Set relative position on .position-relative class
  2.2 Try different values for left, right, top, bottom on .absolute class. Start by not setting left and right or top
  and bottom at the same time, e.g. set top and left. What can you observe?
  2.3 How is absolute within relative different from absolute that is outside of relative?
  2.4 Set high z-index value on .position-absolute class. How does it affect the element?

  TIP: You can use ctrl+f (cmd+f on MacOs) to search for specific content on the page.

  <h2> 3. sticky</h2>
  <p> 1.1 Set sticky position on .position-sticky class and scroll the page to see it work.
    1.2 Note that we placed an HTML element with .position-sticky class outside of the article. This is because sticky
    positioned elements can be affected only by scrolling on their direct parents. </p>

  <h2>IV. Styling text</h2>
  <p>In this section we will focus on styling text. Search for the answers on the Internet.
    1. Color - set font color using `color` CSS rule on .text-style class
    2. Font-size - set font-size CSS rule on .text-style class
    3. Line-height - set line-height CSS rule on .text-style class
    4. font-weight - set font-weight CSS rule on .text-style class
    4.1 Try both, keyword and number values, e.g. `bold` and `800`
    5. Importing fonts and font-family
    5.1 Visit https://fonts.google.com/
    5.2 find fonts that you like
    5.3 Click select style on various flavours of the same font. Selecting font styles is used to save the bandwidth for
    the user, if we do not intend to use certain styles of the font then we should not select them.

    Select the styles. Especially consider the font-weight you set before. `Regular 400` on the list corresponds to the
    font used when no font-weight is used at all.

    Copy font-family CSS rule into your .style-text class. sans-serif part of that rule activates in the situation where
    the previous font could not be loaded, e.g. we misspelled ‘Roboto’ or there is no internet connection. In that case,
    the browser will load the default sans-serif font.

    TIP: Have a look at difference between serif and sans-serif fonts
    TIP: font-family Roboto can be inferred looking at ?family=Roboto part of @import declaration

    7. letter-spacing - set letter-spacing CSS rule on .text-style class
    8. word-spacing - set word-spacing CSS rule on .text-style class
